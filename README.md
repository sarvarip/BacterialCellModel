# TranslationModels
4th year MEng Project - Stochastic whole cell model with detailed description of resource-limited translation: Translation models incorporating slow codons, finite energy, finite ribosomes and finite proteome

Translation Models based on: Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Processes (TASEP), Ribosome Flow Models (RFM), Gillespie algorithm and deterministic modelling (queuing processes)
