# StoCellAtor - StochasticCellCalculator
Stochastic whole cell model with detailed description of resource-limited translation: Model incorporates slow codons, finite energy, finite ribosomes and finite proteome.
See the folder called new_setting for the most recent version of the framework now submitted to Biology.

Translation Models tried: Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Processes (TASEP), Ribosome Flow Models (RFM), deterministic modelling (queuing processes)

CAUTION: The WholeCell_final_par.m in the old folder is not identical to the one in the other folders. The one in the old folder is the older version and will work with the par_test scripts in that folder only. If the par_test scripts in the old folder are to be used with the latest version of WholeCell_final_par.m, then the last two arguments in the function call need to be swapped.
