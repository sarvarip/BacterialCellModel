# TranslationModels
4th year MEng Project - Stochastic whole cell model with detailed description of resource-limited translation: Translation models incorporating slow codons, finite energy, finite ribosomes and finite proteome

Translation Models based on: Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Processes (TASEP), Ribosome Flow Models (RFM), Gillespie algorithm and deterministic modelling (queuing processes)

CAuTION: The WholeCell_final_par.m in the old folder is not identical to the one in the other folders. The one in the old folder is the older version and will work with the par_test scripts in that folder only. If the par_test scripts in the old folder are to be used with the latest version of WholeCell_final_par.m, then the last two arguments in the function call need to be swapped.
